# Exploring Logs

[From Bill Kennedy at Ardan Labs](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2017/05/design-philosophy-on-logging.html):

> What does handling an error mean? It means three things:
>
> - The error has been logged.
> - The application is back to 100% integrity.
> - The current error is not reported any longer.
